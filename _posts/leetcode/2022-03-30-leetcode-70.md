## Description

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

```non
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**

```non
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 45`

## Solution

```cpp
int climbStairs(int n){
    if (n <= 3)
        return n;
    int a = 1, b = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        int c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
    return b;
}
```

## Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

**Example 1:**

```non
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

## Solution

```cpp
struct ListNode* reverseList(struct ListNode* head){
    struct ListNode *next = NULL;
    while (head) {
        struct ListNode *tmp = head->next;
        head->next = next;
        next = head;
        head = tmp;
    }
    return next;
}
```

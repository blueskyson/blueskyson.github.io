## Description

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists in a one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

**Example 1:**

```non
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

## Solution

```cpp
struct ListNode* mergeTwoLists(struct ListNode* list1, struct ListNode* list2){
    struct ListNode *head;
    struct ListNode **cursor = &head;
    
    for (struct ListNode **node; list1 && list2;
         *node = (*node)->next) {
        node = (list1->val < list2->val) ? &list1 : &list2;
        *cursor = *node;   
        cursor = &(*cursor)->next;
    }
    
    *cursor = list1 ? list1 : list2;
    return head;
}
```

## Description

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```non
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```non
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```non
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Example 4:**

```non
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10`<sup>`4`</sup>
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int max = 0, head = -1, tail = 0;
        bool repeat = false;
        int char_idx[256];
        for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
            char_idx[i] = -2;
        }
        
        while(tail < s.size()) {
            // convert ascii code as (int)
            int code = (int)s.at(tail);
                
            if (char_idx[code] > head) {
                int length = tail - head;
                if (length > max) {
                    max = length;
                }
                head = char_idx[code];
            }
            char_idx[code] = tail;
            tail++;
        }
        
        int length = tail - head;
        if (length > max) {
            max = length;
        }
        return max - 1;
    }
};
```

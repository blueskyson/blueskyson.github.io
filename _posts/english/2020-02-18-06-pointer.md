## Pointer Variables

The concept of **pointer** in C++ is quite important for developing **class**. Before talking about pointer, let's learn to find the **address** of a variable by `&` (address) operator.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int alice = 10;
    double bob = 12.5;
    short charlie = 20;
    cout << "alice value = " << alice << endl;
    cout << "alice address = " << &alice << endl;
    cout << "bob value = " << bob << endl;
    cout << "bob address = " << &bob << endl;
    cout << "charlie value = " << charlie << endl;
    cout << "charlie address = " << &charlie << endl;
}
```

```non
alice value = 10
alice address = 0x6dfeec
bob value = 12.5
bob address = 0x6dfee0
charlie value = 20
charlie address = 0x6dfede
```

By putting `&` operator in front of a variable, it returns the first memory address of the variable.

Addresses can be stored in **pointer variables**, every type has its pointer variable of that type. When we store the address of a variable *v* in the pointer *ptr*, we say *ptr* **points to** *v*. A graphical representation is like this:

[![pointer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blueskyson/image-host/master/pointer.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blueskyson/image-host/master/pointer.jpg)

In the image above, *p* points to an **object** of type `int`. Sometimes, a pointer might point to an array, a function, a pointer, etc. So we use the term **object** to describe the memory address stored in a pointer. Let's see another example:

[![pointer-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blueskyson/image-host/master/pointer-2.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blueskyson/image-host/master/pointer-2.jpg)

In this example, we see *s* is directly assigned to *ptr* without `&` operator. This indicates that an array is actually a pointer!

## Pointer Declaration

In pointer's world, `*` is a enormously important character, it has two meanings:

* **Pointer** - In declaring phase, the `*` indicates compiler the type of this variable is pointer. We can image it as a "lock".

* **Dereference operator** - After declaration, get the value stored in the memory address according to the address stored by this pointer.  We can image it as a "key".

```cpp
int a, b[6], *c, *d;  //pointers can be declared along with variables
int* e;               //when declaring, there must be at least one space between type name and pointer
int * f;              //valid
int         *     g;  //valid
int *h = &a;          //assign the address of a to pointer h
int *i = b;           //assign array pointer b to pointer i
int *j[10];           //declare a pointer array (char *argv[] in main function is also a pointer array)
```

## Pointer Assignment

To access the object that a pointer points to, we use the `*` (indirection) operator. We use a simple program to test some operations with pointers.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int alice = 10;
    int *ptr1;
    ptr1 = &alice;    //let ptr1 point to alice

    cout << "The address of alice is:     " << &alice << endl;
    cout << "ptr1 points to:              " << ptr1   << endl;
    cout << "The value of alice is:       " << alice  << endl;
    cout << "The value ptr1 points to is: " << *ptr1  << endl;

    cout << "\nstatement: alice = 20" << endl; //modify value of alice
    alice = 20;

    cout << "The value of alice is:       " << alice  << endl;
    cout << "The value ptr1 points to is: " << *ptr1  << endl;

    cout << "\nstatement: *ptr1 += 10" << endl; //modify *ptr1
    *ptr1 += 10;

    cout << "The value of alice is:       " << alice  << endl;
    cout << "The value ptr1 points to is: " << *ptr1  << endl;

    int bob = 100;
    int *ptr2;
    ptr2 = &bob;     //let ptr2 point to bob

    cout << "\nThe address of bob is:       " << &bob   << endl;
    cout << "The value of bob is:         " << bob    << endl;

    cout << "\n statement: *ptr1 = *ptr2" << endl; //assign values between pointers
    *ptr1 = *ptr2;

    cout << "The value of alice is:       " << alice  << endl;
    cout << "The value ptr1 points to is: " << *ptr1  << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the output of this program, we can see that *alice* corresponds to **ptr1*. Pointers can be manipulated as normal variables.

```non
The address of alice is:     0x6dfee4
ptr1 points to:              0x6dfee4
The value of alice is:       10
The value ptr1 points to is: 10

statement: alice = 20
The value of alice is:       20
The value ptr1 points to is: 20

statement: *ptr1 += 10
The value of alice is:       30
The value ptr1 points to is: 30

The address of bob is:       0x6dfee0
The value of bob is:         100

 statement: *ptr1 = *ptr2
The value of alice is:       100
The value ptr1 points to is: 100
```

## Use 'new' to Allocate Memories

In previous examples, we only show that pointers can point to variables that has been declared. Now we try a new way to allocate a chunk of memory to a pointer. We tell the key word `new` what kind of data we want to store, `new` will find a chunk that is big enough to store that data and return the address. Then this address will be assigned to a pointer.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* ptr;

    cout << "the original address:            " << ptr << endl;
    //show a random address

    ptr = new int;
    //allocate a proper address

    cout << "the address allocated by 'new':  " << ptr << endl;
    //show the proper address

    *ptr = 10;
    cout << "Set the value of *ptr as:        " << *ptr << endl;
    //now we can access *ptr
    return 0;
}
```

```non
the original address:            0x42711e
the address allocated by 'new':  0xdc1610
Set the value of *ptr as:        10
```

If there is not enough memory to allocate, `new` will return `null` pointer. We can simply allocate an address right after pointer declaration like this:

```cpp
    int *p = new int;  //allocate right after declaration

    if (p == null) {   //check if allocate successfully
      cout << "failed to allocate memory";
    }

    *p = ...           //assign a value
```

Also, we can allocate an array via `new`:

```cpp
    int *p = new int[100]; //allocate an array

    if (!p) {              //another way to check if p == null
      cout << "failed to allocate memory";
    }

    p[3] = ...             //assign a value
```

> The memory block that stores variables allocated by `new` is called **heap**, and the memory that stores normally declared variables is called **stack**. For more information, please check out [Memory Layout of C Programs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/).

## Use 'delete' to release memory allocated by 'new'

```cpp
int *p = new int;      //allocate memory with new
int *q = new int[10];
. . .                  //use the memory
delete p;              //free memory with delete when done
p = NULL;              //a good habit to let a deleted pointer point to NULL
delete[] q;
q = NULL;
```

`delete` do releases the memory that *p* points to but not release *p* itself. That is, we can reuse *p* to point to other object. Notice that we should properly release memory when we needn't use it any more. If not doing so, the memory left not used is called **memory leak**. Too many memory leaks cause program allocate no more memory. Memory leaks may even lead a program to crashing.

Here's some code with more usage details of `delete`.

```cpp
int *p = new int;  //ok
delete p;          //ok
delete p;          //not ok, p has been deleted

int v = 3;         //ok
int *q = &v;       //ok
delete q;          //not ok, memory of q is not allocated by new

int *r = NULL;     //ok
delete r;          //ok, deleting a null pointer

int *s = new int[10];  //ok
delete s;              //not ok, s is an array pointer

int *t = new int;      //ok
delete [] t;           //not ok
```

## Dangers of Using Pointers

In the following code, `p` is declared but isn't assigned a proper memory to store. At this time, `p` stores a random address. So when we do this, we will lost data stored in that randomly allocated memory! This kind of error is troublesome and hard to debug.

```cpp
double *p;  //declare a pointer stores a random address
*p = 3.21;  //error, directly assign a value to that address
```

Another danger is called **dangling pointer**, which meanings a pointer points to a data that has been deleted. It usually happens when several pointers point to the same memory.

```cpp
double *p = new double;  //allocate memory to p
double *q = p;           //let q point to the same object as p
*q = 10.9;               //ok, assign *q a value
. . .                    //make use of p and q
delete p;                //release p
*q = 3.3;                //not ok, q is a dangling pointer, we can't access it
```

Here's an image showing dangling pointer.

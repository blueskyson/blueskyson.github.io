## Naming Variables

C++ encourages user declare meaningful variables. For instance, to express "cost of trip", the corresponding variable can be named as `cost_of_trip` or `CostOfTrip`, instead of `cot`, `x`, ...  

The following are valid and invalid C++ variable names

```cpp
int lion;          //valid
int Lion;          //valid and more distinct
int LION;          //valid and even more distinct
Int rabbit;        // invalid, not "Int"
int rabbit_1;      //valid
int _rabbit;       //valid
int 4you;          //invalid, can't start with a number
int come2us;       //valid
int rabbit2;       //valid
int double;        //invalid, "double" is a reserved word in c++
int rabbit-turtle; //invalid, no hyphen allowed
```

## Basic Types

### short  

A short cut of `short int`, which has width of 16 bits. The range of `short` is $ -32,768 $ to $ 32,767 $

### int  

Basic integer type, which has at least 16 bits. But it always has 32 bits on general PC (32/64 bit systems). The range of `int` is $ -2,147,483,648 $ to $ 2,147,483,647 $

### long

A short cut of `long int`. This type has at least 32 bits. So it width is the same as `int` on PC.

### long long

Target type will have width of at least 64 bits. the range is $ -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 $ to $ 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 $

### float

Single precision floating point type. Usually use [IEEE-754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) 32 bit as format. Its range is $ ± 3.4028234 · 10^{38} $

### double

Double precision floating point type. Usually use [IEEE-754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) 64 bit as format. Its range is $ ± 1.7976931348623157 · 10^{308} $

### char

Type for storing text code, which has width of 1 bit. Usually, one `char` stores one [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) code, every ASCII code correspond with a common character. For example, 65 for 'A'.

## Check Widths of Basic Types

We can use **sizeof()** function to check the width of every type.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout << "width of short      is " << sizeof(short) << " bytes" << endl;
  cout << "width of int        is " << sizeof(int) << " bytes" << endl;
  cout << "width of long       is " << sizeof(long) << " bytes" << endl;
  cout << "width of long long  is " << sizeof(long long) << " bytes" << endl;
  cout << "width of float      is " << sizeof(float) << " bytes" << endl;
  cout << "width of double     is " << sizeof(double) << " bytes" << endl;
  cout << "width of char       is " << sizeof(char) << " byte" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Note that 1 byte equals 8 bit. The result will be:

```bash
width of short      is 2 bytes
width of int        is 4 bytes
width of long       is 4 bytes
width of long long  is 8 bytes
width of float      is 4 bytes
width of double     is 8 bytes
width of char       is 1 byte
```

By the way, we can also use **sizeof()** to check a variable's width, such as:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int int_num = 33030;
  double double_num = 5.55;
  char str[20] = "Hello World";
  int int_array[5] = {0};       //{0} is used for initialize all integers in array to 0
  cout << "width of int_num    is " << sizeof(int_num) << " bytes" << endl;
  cout << "width of double_num is " << sizeof(double_num) << " bytes" << endl;
  cout << "width of str        is " << sizeof(str) << " bytes" << endl;
  cout << "width of int_array  is " << sizeof(int_array) << " bytes" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

```bash
width of int_num    is 4 bytes
width of double_num is 8 bytes
width of str        is 20 bytes
width of int_array  is 20 bytes
```

## Signed Types

In order to simplify the calculation, `short, int, long, long long` follow [2's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement) format. The leftmost bit of a signed integer (sign bit) is 0 if the number is positive or zero, 1 if it's negative. For instance, the largest 32-bit `int` is  

 $ 01111111111111111111111111111111 $

which has the value $ 2,147,483,647\\ (2^{31} – 1) $ .  
Here are some other examples:

$ 01111111111111111111111111111110 => 2,147,483,646\\\\01111111111111111111111111111101 => 2,147,483,645\\\\01111111111111111111111111111100 => 2,147,483,644\\\\...\\\\00000000000000000000000000000010 => 2\\\\00000000000000000000000000000001 => 1\\\\00000000000000000000000000000000 => 0 $

While sign bit is 1 such as  

$ 11111111111111111111111111111111 => -1\\\\11111111111111111111111111111110 => -2\\\\11111111111111111111111111111101 => -3\\\\...\\\\10000000000000000000000000000010 => -2,147,483,646\\\\ 10000000000000000000000000000001 => -2,147,483,647\\\\10000000000000000000000000000000 => -2,147,483,648 $

## Unsigned Types

An integer with no sign bit is said to be unsigned, that is, it has no negative value. We can declare unsigned types like below:

### unsigned short  

16 bits, The range of `unsigned short` is $ 0 $ to $ 65,535 $

### unsigned int  

Having at least 16 bits, but it always has 32 bits on general PC (32/64 bit systems). The range of `unsigned int` is $ 0 $ to $ 4,294,967,295 $

### unsigned long

A short cut of `long int`. This type has at least 32 bits. So it width is the same as `int` on PC.

### unsigned long long

Target type will have width of at least 64 bits. the range is $ 0 $ to $ 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 $

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  unsigned int a;
  unsigned long long b;
  //statements...
  return 0;
}
```

## Constant

Use put **const** before any type to declare a constant. Declaring a constant to store a value that used frequently can make a program safer and more efficient. The value of a constant can't be change after it's been declared. If doing so, error message comes up.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  const unsigned int a = 10;
  const double b = 100.5;
  a = 11; //try to change the value of a constant
  return 0;
}
```

When compiling, we get this error

```
test.cpp: In function 'int main()':
test.cpp:6:5: error: assignment of read-only variable 'a'
   a = 11; //try to change the value of a constant
```

## Structure Variables

Suppose you want to store data of a student, you may store his name, age, height, score... Though an array can store several elements, every element must be the same type! For instance, an array cannot store both `int` and `float`. So, when we need to store a collection of related data items, it is recommended to use a `structure`.

Here's an example of a structure that stores data of student.

```cpp
struct student {  //structure declaration
    string name;
    int age;
    double height;
    int ID;
};
```

`struct` is a reserved key word that tells compiler to make a user-defined structure. `student` is called a **structure name** or a **structure tag**. Every type declared in a structure is called **member**, so the structure `student` has 4 members.

[![structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blueskyson/image-host/master/struct.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blueskyson/image-host/master/struct.jpg)

The members of a structure are stored in memory in the order in which they're declared. Now, we can use `student` as a template to create variables. Use `.` operator to access members in structure.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

struct student {  //structure declaration
    string name;
    int age;
    double height;
    int ID;
};

int main() {
    student a;  //declare variable a as structure student

    a.name = "Alice";     //use . to access members
    a.age = 13;           //
    a.height = 155.6666;  //
    a.ID = 1234;          //

    cout << "student name  : " << a.name << endl;
    cout << "student age   : " << a.age << endl;
    cout << "student height: " << a.height << endl;
    cout << "student ID    : " << a.ID << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

```non
student name  : Alice
student age   : 13
student height: 155.667
student ID    : 1234
```

> If you are familiar with structure in C, you may notice that C++ allows you to omit key word `struct` before structure name. This avoid some error causing by omitting key word `struct`.

Structure initializers follow rules similar to those for array initializers. Structures also allows us to copy values from one to another.

```cpp
    student b = {"Bob", 14, 175.5, 1233};
    student c = b;  //copy member values from b to c

    cout << "student name  : " << c.name << endl;
    cout << "student age   : " << c.age << endl;
    cout << "student height: " << c.height << endl;
    cout << "student ID    : " << c.ID << endl;
```

```non
student name  : Bob
student age   : 14
student height: 175.5
student ID    : 1233
```

We can declare variables right after defining a structure

```cpp
struct zoo {
    int lions;
    int penguins;
    int koalas;
} taipei_zoo, helsinki_zoo; //two zoo variables
```

We can even declare a structure without tag. However, we can't declare variables of this type any more.

```cpp
struct {
    int x, y, z;
} position; //a variable that has no tag
```

Construct and access members of a structure array.

```cpp
student stu[2] = { {"Alice", 13, 155, 1234},  
                   {"Bob", 14, 175, 1233}
                 };
student class_A[30];
cin >> class_A[0].name;
cout << class_A[0].name;
```

Structure and sizeof()

```cpp
student arr[30];
cout << "size of struct student: " << sizeof(student) << end;
cout << "size of arr: " << sizeof(arr) << endl;
cout << "size of one element in arr: " << sizeof(arr[0]) << endl;
```

```non
size of struct student: 48
size of arr: 1440
size of one element in arr: 48
```

## Bit Field

You can assign specific bits to members, this technique are usually implemented to low-level program design. For more information, check out [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bit-fields-c/) : )

```cpp
struct date {
    unsigned int dd : 5;   //5 bits for day   (1 ~ 31)
    unsigned int mm : 4;   //4 bits for month (1 ~ 12)
    unsigned int yy : 20;  //other bits for year (0 ~ 2^20 - 1)
    unsigned int : 3;      //3 bits unused
};
```
